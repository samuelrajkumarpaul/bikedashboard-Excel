The project revolves around analyzing a dataset comprising various fields including ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Age Updated, and Purchased Bike. The primary objective is to clean the data, address issues like duplicates, irrelevant entries, spelling mistakes, and formatting inconsistencies.

 Key Steps: 

1. Data Cleaning: 
 - Identify and remove duplicate entries.
 - Eliminate irrelevant data points.
 - Correct spelling mistakes and ensure proper alignment.
 - Address any extra gaps or formatting issues.

2. Pivot Table Analysis: 
 - Create three pivot tables to analyze different aspects of the dataset.
 - The first pivot table calculates the average income and number of purchased bikes based on gender.
 - The second pivot table categorizes data by commute distance and counts the number of purchased bikes, represented in a bar graph.
 - The third pivot table focuses on the count of purchased bikes and displays it as a line graph.

3. Bike Sales Dashboard Creation: 
 - Develop a comprehensive bike sales dashboard to visualize key insights.
 - Utilize Excel features such as slicers to enhance interactivity and user experience.
 - Connect all pivot tables to the dashboard to ensure real-time updates and synchronization.
 
 Excel Features Utilized: 
- Pivot tables for data analysis and aggregation.
- Slicers for interactive filtering and navigation.
- Graphs (bar and line) to visualize trends and patterns.
- Excel formulas (e.g., IF, TRIM, PROPER) for data manipulation and cleaning.

By leveraging these Excel features and conducting thorough data analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights into bike sales trends and facilitate informed decision-making for stakeholders.
